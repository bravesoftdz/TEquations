# Notes

 - This library has been written using Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
 - The Parse folder has been originally created by Egbert van Nes (<a href="http://www.sparcs-center.org/expression-parser">link</a>)
 - Installation, documentation and examples can be found in the Source folder

The `Source` folder contains the source files of the library and it can be used in VCL/FMX projects. The `Component` folder instead contains the component for the Delphi IDE that is compatible only with Firemonkey.
