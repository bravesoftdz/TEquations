# Notes

Both components, `Visual` and `NonVisual`, are identical (they can do the same things) but the visual component, as a plus, can draw on a `TRectangle` an xy plan and plot the equations.

 - `Visual`: it works only with FMX and it can draw on a TRectangle the equation
 - `NonVisual`: it works with VCL and FMX but it cannot draw the function
