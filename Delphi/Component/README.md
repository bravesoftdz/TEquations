# Notes

Both components, `Visual` and `NonVisual`, are identical (they can do the same things) but the visual component, as a plus, can draw an x-y Cartesian plane and plot the equation.

 - `Visual`: it works only with FMX and it can draw the equation on a surface
 - `NonVisual`: it works with VCL and FMX but it cannot draw the function
