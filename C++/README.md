# Notes

 - This library has been written using VS 2017 **without** the inclusion of the stdafx header.
 - The sources can be used with every compiler that supports C++14 (or higher).
 - Installation, documentation and examples can be found in the Source folder

While creating the library the C++ language standard was `/std:c++14` but if your compiler supports only C++11 you should be able to compile the files anwyay.
