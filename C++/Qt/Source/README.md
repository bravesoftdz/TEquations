# Setup

Before installing this be sure that you have read the <a href="https://github.com/albertodev01/TEquations/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Qt/README.md">README.md</a> in the previous folder. Let's start:

 1. Download the plugin source files that you can find here and place them in a folder called `EquationPlot` (or whatever!)
 2. Donwload the library source files and place them in the `EquationPlot` folder. It should look like this:
 
 <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/albertodev01/TEquations/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Qt/github_images/dir.png" /></p>
 
 3. Place this folder somewhere (preferably in the same folder as your main project) and you are ready to go!
 
 #Usage example
 
 Let's do a quick example.
 
  1. Create a new widget application (I use MSVC 2017)
  2. Right click on the project name on the left > Add Existing Files > go to the `EquationPlot` folder and import all the files. You should have something like this:
