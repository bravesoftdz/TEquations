# Installation

**Short Version**

You just need to import the content of this folder and add the file `mXparser.dll` in the project's references. That's all!

**Long version**

Here's a step by step installation guide that's good for Visual Studio:

 1. Create a new empty project (for example a Windows Console Application).
 2. Save everything, just in case.


I'd recommend the usage of .NET 4.7.2 (or higher) and C# 7.0 (or higher).

# Generic usage
