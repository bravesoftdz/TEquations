# Installation

**Short Version**

You just need to import the content of this folder and add the file `mXparser.dll` in the project's references. That's all!

**Long version**

Here's a step by step installation guide that's good for Visual Studio:

 1. Create a new empty project called `TestEquation` (for example a C# Console Application).
 2. Save everything, just in case.
 3. In the solution explorer: right click on References > Add Reference > Browse > Select `mXparser.dll` > Click Ok
 4. Now follow these steps: Project > Add existing item > Select `Equation.cs` and `Fraction.cs` > Click Add
 5. Type on the head of the file `using EquationSolver;` and you're now ready for the next section!
