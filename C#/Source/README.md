# Installation

**Short Version**

You just need to import the content of this folder and add the file `mXparser.dll` in the project's references. That's all!

**Long version**

Here's a step by step installation guide that's good for Visual Studio:

 1. Create a new empty project (for example a C# Console Application).
 2. Save everything, just in case.
 3. In the solution explorer: right click on References > Add Reference > Browse > Select `mXparser.dll` > Click Ok

The usage of .NET 4.6.1 (or higher) is needed, otherwise the `mXparser` library won't work. I'd recommend the usage of .NET 4.7.1 (or higher) and C# 7.0 (or higher).
