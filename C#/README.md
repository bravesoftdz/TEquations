# Notes

 - This library has been written using VS 2017
 - The library has been created with .NET 4.7.2 and C# 7.3
 - I have used `mXparser` as expression parser, more info on their [website](http://mathparser.org/)
 - Installation, documentation and examples can be found in the Source folder

Note: `System.ValueTuple` has been used here; if you aren't using .NET 4.7.x (for example 4.6.3) you have to download the `System.ValueTuple` from NuGet.
